# Machine-Learning

This script demonstrates how to build a simple linear regression model using Python to predict student performance based on various factors. The dataset, student-mat.csv, contains information about students' grades, study time, absences, and failures. The script uses libraries such as 'pandas' for data manipulation, 'numpy' for numerical operations, and 'scikit-learn' for machine learning algorithms. It loads the data, selects specific columns, and splits it into training and testing sets, with 10% of the data reserved for testing. A linear regression model is then instantiated and trained on the training data. The model's accuracy is evaluated on the test data, and predictions are made on the test set, with each prediction printed alongside the corresponding input features and true label. To run the script, please make sure you have the required libraries installed, place the student-mat.csv file in the same directory as the script, and run it using Python. The output includes the first few rows of the dataset, the model's accuracy, and predictions made by the model.
